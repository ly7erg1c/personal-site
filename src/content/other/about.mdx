I'm a security professional on the blue team specializing in SOC operations, incident response and threat intelligence.

In my free time I work with several community groups like [Nashsec](https://www.meetup.com/nashsec/events/303827673/) and [BSides Nashville](https://bsidesnash.org/).
I'm an avid data hoarder with a keen interest in aquaculture, biohacking, tea, and advocating for freedom of information for all people.
