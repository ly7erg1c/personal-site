[Distributed Chaos (DC)](https://www.distributedchaos.org/) is a grassroots movement focused on creating and nurturing local hacker communities without bureaucratic overhead. We believe in the power of decentralized, self-organizing groups that foster innovation, learning, and collaboration in technology.


## Features

- On the site you will find a collection of resources curated to help local hacker groups get off the ground and succeed. 
- We are working on a directory of active groups, with a simple, defined file-format. This aims to make contributions as simple as editing a .yaml or .md file and opening a pull request!
